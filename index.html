    <p>CSS is Cascading Style Sheet. It is a type of language in HTML that helps customize the color of the words in the webpage. This helps the webpage become more vibrant and coloruful. The in line part of the code is whats inside of the file with the HTML that creates the code. This code is what helps us display what's on the webpage. The internal tag is the entire HTML document where the in lines are represented inside of. Finally, the external tag is things like the CSS code and the jpg file which is a seperate file from the html document but still helps create the webpage.</p>
